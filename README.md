Switch Windows 10 virtual desktops with hotkeys. AutoHotKey v2

This script is based on an AutoHotKey v1 script found [here](https://www.computerhope.com/tips/tip224.htm). It rebinds WindowsKey + # to directly switch to any virtual destkop.

I converted it to [version 2](https://www.autohotkey.com/v2/) and added a feature to have one key toggle through all virtual desktops (default: F1 key).
