Switch Windows 10 virtual desktops with hotkeys. AutoHotKeyV2

This script is based on an autohotkey version 1 script found here: https://www.computerhope.com/tips/tip224.htm. It rebinds WindowsKey + # to directly switch to any virtual destkop.

I converted it to version 2 and added a feature to have one key toggle through all virtual desktops (default: F1 key).
